# Gravity Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is a gravity simulation that models the interactions of particles under the influence of gravity. It allows users to visualize and interact with the simulation in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time particle simulation with gravity
- Interactive UI for selecting and manipulating particles
- Configurable simulation parameters
- Visualization of particle states and interactions

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

   - GCC or Clang
   - Make

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Follow any additional setup instructions specific to your operating system.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command:

make
```

## Running the Simulation

After building the project, you can run the simulation with:

```bash
./bin/gravity-sim
```

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
make check
```

## Usage

- **Camera Controls**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the camera. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Particle Interaction**: Click and drag to select particles. Use the "Make Static" button to change particle states.
- **Simulation Control**: Press `R` to reset the camera.
